âœ¨ About the Application
 - This is a React application built with Vite, ensuring fast development and an optimized build process.
 - In the spirit of the AI era, I used GitHub Copilot for some refactoring and suggestions â€” but a significant amount of effort went in manually to make this beautiful and functional To-Do app.
 - Due to limited time and a few inconsistencies in the provided Figma design, the final look differs slightly from the mockups. However, all core functionalities are fully implemented, and thereâ€™s still plenty of room for improvement in future.

ðŸ›  Code & Design Highlights
 - State Management: Efficient data handling is crucial for seamless user experience. I chose React Context for clean and reliable state management.
 - Project Structure: The folder and file organization is thoughtfully designed with reusability and scalability in mind, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend.
